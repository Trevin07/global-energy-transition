# 🌍 Global Energy Transition: Climate Impact Dashboard

🏆 **Winner - Data Visualization Competition**  
📍 *6th Bangladesh Economics Summit 2025*  
🎯 Theme: Climate and Trade

This project explores the global transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy and its impact on CO₂ emissions across decades (1960–2023). It was awarded first place in a data visualization competition organized by the Bangladesh Economics Summit.

## 📈 Highlights

- 🔥 Fossil Fuel vs Renewable Energy Usage (Global + USA)
- 🌡️ Correlation Heatmap between fuel types and CO₂ emissions
- 📉 Declining fossil fuel use and rising renewables (USA)
- 🌍 Tableau Dashboard for Global Performance
- 📊 Country-specific energy and emissions comparisons

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Tableau (for interactive dashboards)
- Python (data cleaning + charting in notebook)
- World Bank & UN Comtrade datasets

## 📘 Storyline

The project titled **"The Fossil Fuel Paradox"** uncovers how:
- Renewable energy adoption **correlates negatively** with fossil fuel use.
- CO₂ emissions **vary by economic groupings**, with wealthier nations shifting faster.
- The USA shows strong signs of energy transition since 2004.
